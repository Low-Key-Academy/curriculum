# Welcome to Low Key Academy

We're excited to see you here and we hope you're ready to learn how to code! Before we get started, we want to set you up for success with a few tips.

1. **Join our Slack channel**. We're creating a community of students, instructors, and other friendly people who want to help you learn how to code and keep your momentum going.
1. **Be consistent**. Learning any new skill takes time. Even if you're a programming wunderkind, learning how to build complex apps and acquiring the skills you need to land a fancy-pants job at a big company will take practice, commitment, and time. We recommend that you set aside 10-15 minutes per day. Put something in your calendar, set an alarm on your phone, or do whatever else works for you to keep coming back.
1. **Don't memorize syntax**. This one is really hard for a lot of new students to grasp, but it's so important. Let's illustrate what we mean with a quick example. The code snippets below all do the same thing in different languages:
      ```python
      # python
      for i in range(10):
        print(i)
      ```

      ```javascript
      // javascript
      for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(i);
      }
      ```

      ```csharp
      // C#
      for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++)
      {
        Console.WriteLine(i);
      }
      ```
      We've seen students generally take two very different approaches to learning the information above.
      1. **The wrong way**: Memorize that `for i in range(10):` is how to make a loop that runs 10 times in Python.
      1. **The right way**: Learn that many languages have a construct called the `for loop`, understand when and why they're used, and trust that information about the specific sequence of characters for a particular programming language will be easy to find.

      Once you begin to understand that many programming languages share general concepts, learning new programming languages will be a breeze because you won't have to start from scratch. Even learning your first language will be easier, because big problems can't be solved with memorization. Instead, you need to arm yourself with tools and creativity!
1. **Be fearless and ask questions**. The beauty of software is that we can mess it up and, for the most part, everything will be okay. We're not trying to tell you to be reckless and delete your operating system, but we are telling you that it's okay to experiment and be curious. If you want to test your assumptions about something, do it! If you want to understand why something works, pick it apart and break it! If you think that knocking down the wall in your living room to create an open floor plan, you don't get many chances to get it right. With software, it's much less expensive to mess something up. At worst, you'll have to restart your computer (and you probably won't even have to answer to your spouse). If you want to really go crazy, just back up your computer and code away! We'll let you know when something you're doing might be dangerous, so get in there and have fun!

Now that we have that out of the way, pick a track and let's get started!
