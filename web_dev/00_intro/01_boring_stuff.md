# But First, Some Boring Stuff

Okay, okay. We know you're ready to get in there and start building apps, but we need to walk before we can run and, in this case, we need to crawl before we can walk.

## Folder Setup

Before we do anything, we need to step into the glamorous world of folder hierarchy and file naming conventions. Now that you're on the edge of your seat, let's get into it!

Every software engineer has their own way of organizing their computer's file system, but most of the time, their goal is usually the same: make life easier. It's frustrating when we aren't able to find what we're looking for, so throughout Low Key Academy we'll be giving you tips about where and how to set up your projects for success.

First, let's do something that you'd have to do once you land that shiny new job: set up a place to put all your code. We want to make a folder that's easy to find, so we'll put it right at the top of our folder hierarchy. We recommend going to the `root` directory (folder) of your operating system. On a Mac, the root directory is usually named after the user you used to log in to your computer and can be found on the favorites panel in finder next to the house icon. On a PC, it's usually named after the drive, typically `C://`. Find the root directory on your computer and create a new folder called `dev`. From now on, we'll refer to this as the "dev folder", and we'll have you put all of your classwork inside it, so don't delete it or misplace it!

A quick note: We prefer the root directory to other common folders like Desktop, Documents, etc. for two key reasons:

1. It's faster to navigate to when we start using the command line.
1. It's usually not included in any automated backups like iCloud or OneDrive. Cloud backups are great for most things, but we'll have other ways of backing up our code once we get going and some of our projects will get so large that keeping them up-to-date via cloud sync will really muck up our experience. If you decided to put your dev folder somewhere other than the home folder, make sure automatic cloud syncing is turned off for the dev folder!

## Pro Tips

- It's a good idea to add your dev folder to your favorites. You can do that by clicking the star icon on PC in the file explorer or by dragging the folder into the favorites panel in Finder on Mac.
- **Never** use spaces or slashes in your folder or file names. Seriously, don't do it. Each programming language or framework has its own conventions, whether you use dashes-to-split-words, or_underscores, or camelCase, or even PascalCase, it doesn't really matter at the end of the day. Just please, we beg you to heed this advice, and don't say we didn't warn you!
