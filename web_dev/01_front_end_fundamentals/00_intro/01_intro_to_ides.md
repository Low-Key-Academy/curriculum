# Text Editors (IDEs)

Before we can dive in and write HTML, we need to make sure we have the right tools at our disposal.

## Code Has Spellcheck Too (Sort of)

When you write something, it's nice to have a word processor spit out all those green and red squiggly lines under your writing. It means that something needs to be corrected and it protects you from looking foolish in front of other people. When you're writing an essay, a word processor is the right tool for the job.

Writing code is actually similar to writing anything else in some ways; there are clearly defined rules and even grammar, and red and green squiggly lines can help let you know when your code will work and when it won't. When you're writing code, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or text editor is the right tool for the job.

## The Right Tool for the Job

There are a myriad of IDEs and text editors out there and for the most part the one you use is just a matter of personal preference. However, not all text editors are built the same. Some have tons of features for certain languages and frameworks, others are great general-purpose editors where extensions are available for a large swath of languages, some don't do much more than allowing you to save some text into a file. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, but we highly recommend installing a solid, general-purpose text editor to get your feet wet and installing additional, more specialized IDEs when you're committed to learning a specific framework. In fact, many engineers have more than one IDE they work in regularly for different languages or tasks.

## Installing Your First IDE

We highly recommend that you start with Visual Studio Code. It's an amazing general-purpose editor built by Microsoft. It can handle a wide range of languages and is useful for writing code meant for all sorts of different applications. It's a great starting place and likely an editor you'll come back to regularly. Install it from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com) before moving forward.
