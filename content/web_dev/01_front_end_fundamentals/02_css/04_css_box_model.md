# The CSS Box Model

Changing sizes and colors is useful, but if we're going to get anywhere near creating the kinds of visual displays we've become accustomed to on the web, we need to understand the CSS box model.

The CSS box model is essentially how CSS works at its core. Each element on the page is surrounded by its own box (literally a rectangle). This box defines the boundaries of an element. You may have noticed that when you added a background color to an element, it changed the background of your element in the shape of a rectangle. That rectangle is just the element's CSS box!
