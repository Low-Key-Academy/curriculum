# Class Act

You've been hired to do some freelance work on a blogging website. The blogger wants a new look and feel for their content. Your job is to follow their instructions to make their site beautiful.

Use what you know about CSS classes to do the job. The default element styles are already in place and some classes are already in use; add classes or modify existing classes to finish the job!

[Download your client's HTML page](../../../../curriculum_companions/web_dev/fe_fun/class_act/index.html) and put it in a folder called `class_act` somewhere in your `dev` folder.

Your client wants you to do the following:
1. Change the background color for the main header and the lists to `yellow`
      - Can you modify an existing class to do this? 
1. Gross, now it looks like the site is impossible to read, change the text for the stuff in the yellow backgrounds to `black`
1. Let's add a little variation. Give the first and third lists a `2px` thick, `solid`, `green` border
      - Learn how to use the `border` property <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border" target="_blank">here</a>
1. The last paragraph really doesn't have enough pop. Make a class that defines a secondary background color and make it `pink`
