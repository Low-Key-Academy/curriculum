No matter what your goals are as a web developer, you won't get far if you don't understand the basics of the front end. The front end is a general term for the parts of a website the user actually interacts with. That means every button, link, login form, shopping cart, or anything else you would access using your web browser.

## Web Browsers

We're going to assume that you've used web browsers like Chrome or Safari before (otherwise we'd love to know how you're taking this lesson) and it probably feels like magic most of the time; punch in a URL and in less time than it'd take to make a cup of coffee you're uploading cat videos for the world to see. In reality, web browsers have one major task: take HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the user-inputted URL and convert it into what the website's programmers want the user to see. In other words, a web browser's job is to interpret and display a website's front end.

If a browser's job is to display a website's front end, then it's our job to learn how to make our web browser do our bidding! We'll start with HTML, which defines the contents of a web page, then we'll move on to CSS, which defines how a web page looks, and finally, we'll move on to JavaScript, which is used for all sorts of actions like getting information from a server.
